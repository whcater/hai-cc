**The ultimate desktop GUI for `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`. Break free from the terminal and unlock the full potential of AI-assisted coding.**

`claude-code` is a fantastic tool, but its command-line interface and single-provider nature can be limiting. **cc-copilot** is here to change that. It's an open-source, cross-platform desktop app that wraps `claude-code` in a powerful and intuitive interface, designed for a modern developer workflow.
