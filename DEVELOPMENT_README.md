### 🌐 Browser Testing

The application includes a browser demo mode that works without Electron:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
3. The terminal will show demo mode with interactive features
4. All UI components are fully functional

### 🚀 Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview built app

# Package for distribution
npm run build:mac    # Build macOS .dmg
npm run build:win    # Build Windows .exe
npm run build:linux  # Build Linux package
```

### 📋 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
